This script will look for any gmetad.conf files in /etc/gmetad. It will then grab the xml_port, and attempt to connect to each port.
It will grab the first 512 bytes of data. If it retrieves no data, or cannot connect it will then restart gmetad (with -r flag)

Things to do:

- Have it restart only the instance that is down
-Have it verify xml tag in the data to verify it is xml
