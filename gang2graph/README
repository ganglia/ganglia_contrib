USAGE

This pulls the XML file from gmetad (localhost:8651 by default) and pumps
it into Graphite (localhost:2023 the carbon-aggregator port by default).

I run it as a minutely cronjob:

    * * * * * root cd /home/web/gang2graph; perl gang2graph.pl

With 160 hosts and 38,000 metrics the elapsed time is less than 3 seconds
on a 4100 series AMD Opteron, but it is hobbled by Graphite's disk writing.
For this reason, gang2graph support specify a set of hosts to send to
Graphite, ignoring the rest.  Simply set the $host variable in gang2graph.pl
to a set of hosts to copy and only those will be copied.  The checking is a
regex, so subsets of hostnames works.  To copy metrics from this set of hosts:

    apb00.clearspring.com
    apb01.clearspring.com
    apw00.clearspring.com
    apw01.clearspring.com

but exclude apm*, adm*, etc. I use this $hosts:

    ['apb', 'apw']
